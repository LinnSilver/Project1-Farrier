        <h3>Wher I work</h3>
        <p> My work area is Västergötland and Örebro County, starting from Töreboda. I shoe and work all types of horses
            from hobby/forest horses to high level competition horses in all disciplines
        </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>

        <h3>More abot me</h3>
        <p> A solid horse girl who has been involved with horses since I was eight years old. Both at riding school,
            with several own horses and worked in several different stables. Both in Sweden and Denmark. With everything
            from stable maintenance and riding to assistant and stable manager. I currently have two young horses that I
            am training.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the beginning of 2009, I have invested in farriery full-time. First, two years of apprenticeship at
            the Academy of Crafts with one of Sweden's best farriers. Then a year of further education at the Biological
            Vocational College in Skara. In June 2014, I also took a journeyman's certificate in a butcher shop. To keep
            myself as up-to-date as possible, I regularly compete in farriery and attend courses and clinics.
