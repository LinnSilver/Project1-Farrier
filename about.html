    <h3>More about me</h3>
    <p> I have devoted a large part of my life to horses since I was eight years old. First I went to riding school, and later it was a natural urge to acquire my first horse. For some years, I trained foals into adult horses. I have worked in stables both in Sweden and Denmark with everything from stable maintenance and riding to assistant and stable manager. </p>
    <p> In 2009, I started investing in farrier profession full-time. I first went through a two-year apprenticeship at the Academy of Crafts and had the privilege of being apprenticed to one of Sweden's best farriers. I then furthered my education at the University of Applied Sciences in Skara. To then take my journeyman exam and receive the journeyman of the year award. To continue developing, I regularly attend courses and competitions for farriers. </p>
