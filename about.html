            <h3>Wher I work</h3>
            <p> My work area is Västergötland and Örebro County, starting from Töreboda. I shoe and work all types of
                horses
                from hobby/forest horses to high level competition horses in all disciplines
            </p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <h4>Academy of Crafts Stockholm 2 years</h4>
            <p>The vocational school Hantverksakademin has developed a modern craft education with clear guidelines and
                a solid apprenticeship.</p>
            <h4>Biological Vocational School Skara 1 year</h4>
            <p>BYS farrier school in Skara was the first in Sweden to be certified by EFFA, the European Federation of
                Farrier Association.
                They continue to be at the forefront of teaching and quality as they have been since the school was
                started in the 18th century.

            <p>Passed journeyman exam with the award journeyman of the year.</p>
            <h4>Approved by the Swedish Agricultural Agency</h4>

            <h3>More abot me</h3>
            <p> I have devoted a large part of my life to horses since I was eight years old. I started at riding school
                and then got my own horses
                and have also for many years trained foals into adult horses.
                I have worked in stables both in Sweden and Denmark with everything from stable maintenance and riding
                to assistant and stable manager.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2009, I started investing in farriery full-time. I first went through a two-year apprenticeship at
                the Academy of
                Crafts and had the privilege of being apprenticed to one of Sweden's best farriers.
                After that, I furthered my education at the Biological Vocational College in Skara. To then take my
                journeyman test and receive the
                journeyman of the year award. In order to continue to develop, I regularly attend courses and compete in
                farriery.
