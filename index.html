        <h2>Your Ferier in the midle of Sweden</h2>
            <p>When your horse needs new shoes, accuracy and precision are very important because in order for your horse to get well-made shoes that protect hooves, feet and legs. 
                There are great stresses that the shoe must withstand in order to protect the hooves and legs every day.
            </p>
        <h3>Yers of experiens and edukation</h3>
            <p>Experience is important when you don't want to compromise on the quality of your horse's shoes. Over ten years of experience in farriery. Basic education and further education with completed journeyman's certificate and a period as an apprentice. 
                All so that you can feel safe that your horse is receiving the best care. The fact that I compete in blacksmithing is because it is so much fun and also 
                comes in handy for the more challenging shoe jobs.
