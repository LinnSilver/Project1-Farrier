            <h2>Your Farrier in the middle of Sweden</h2>
            <p>When your horse needs new shoes, accuracy and precision are important because in order for your 
                horse to get well-made shoes that protect hooves feet and legs. There are great stresses that 
                the shoe must withstand in to protect the hooves and legs every day.
            </p>
            <h3>Years of experience and education</h3>
            <p>The experience of your farrier is significant when you do not want to compromise on the quality 
                of your horse's feet. Over ten years of experience working as a farrier. Basic education and 
                further education with completed journeyman's certificate and a period as an apprentice. All 
                so that you can feel safe that your horse is receiving the best care. The fact that I compete in 
                forging is because it is so much fun, and it helps me to always have the knowledge close at hand 
                for challenging shoe jobs.

            <h3>Farriers Association for your safety</h3>
            <p>
                Being a member of both of our Swedish industry organizations is a matter of course for me.
            </p>
            <p>The trade association, District Farriers (DH) protects the interests of professional farriers.
                Requirements for membership are that you hold an F tax slip and individual liability insurance.
                An older, but not pronounced, trade organization is Swedish
            </p>
            <p>
                The Farriers' Association (SHF) protects the craft within the profession and arranges and organizes
                craft
                competitions within the profession. SHF requires that members have an education that is approved by
                Sweden's
                farrier association. To approve a training, the SHF association requires full transparency in
                the
                training and the right to examination. Hence, there are several educations that are not approved by SHF,
                even though they are approved by authorities.
