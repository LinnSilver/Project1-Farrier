    <h2>Your Farrier in the middle of Sweden</h2>
    <p>Let me help you with the most important, your horse shoes. I shoe and process hooves on all types of horses, from hobby and forest horses to horses that compete at a high level in all disciplines. I work with private individuals, companies and riding schools.</p>
    <h3>Years of experience and education</h3>
    <p>The experience of your farrier is important when you do not want to compromise on the quality of the shoeing of your horse's feet. There are great stresses that the shoe must withstand to protect the hooves and legs every day. With over ten years of experience working as a farrier, I know that accuracy and precision are most important, in order for your horse to get well-made shoes. Basic education and further education with completed journeyman's certificate and a period as an apprentice, all so that you can feel safe that your horse is receiving the best care. The fact that I compete in forging is because it is so much fun, and it helps me to always have the knowledge close at hand for challenging shoe jobs.</p>

    <h3>Farriers Association for your safety</h3>
    <p> Being a member of both of our Swedish industry organizations is a matter of course for me. </p>
    <p>The trade association, District Farriers (DH) protects the interests of professional farriers. Requirements for membership are that you hold an F tax slip and individual liability insurance. An older trade organization i Sweden.</p>
    <p> The Farriers' Association (SHF) protects the craft within the profession and arranges and organizes craft competitions within the profession. SHF requires that members have an education that is approved by Sweden's farrier association. To approve a training, the SHF association requires full transparency in the training and the right to examination. Hence, there are several educations that are not approved by SHF, even though they are approved by authorities.</p>
